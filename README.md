# ExtendedGCD

## Description
This program is a simple realisation of the Extended Euclidean algorithm.

## Features
- Calculating the greatest common divisor
- Calculating the modular inverse of a number if the GCD is 1
- Finding (y * m) + (x * a) = GCD using the Extended Euclidean algorithm

## Usage
1. Choose the number that will be 'a'
2. Choose the modulo number that will be 'm'
3. Choose to continue or not
4. Get the result
